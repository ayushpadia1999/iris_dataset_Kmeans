# iris_dataset_Kmeans
Clustering is an unsupervisedlearning method that allows us to group set of objects based on similar characteristics. 
In general, it can help you find meaningful structure among your data, group similar data together and discover underlying patterns.
One of the most common clustering methods is K-means algorithm.
The goal of this algorithm isto partition the data into set such that the total sum of squared distances from each point to the mean point of the cluster is minimized.
K means works through the following iterative process:

1.Pick a value for k (the number of clusters to create)

2.Initialize k ‘centroids’ (starting points) in your data

3.Create your clusters. Assign each point to the nearest centroid.

4.Make your clusters better. Move each centroid to the center of its cluster.

5.Repeat steps 3–4 until your centroids converge.
